        <br>
        <h2>How do I sign up for an event?</h2>
        <p>To sign up for an event, click on "New RSVP", and select the event you are trying to sign up
            for, then select your name from the dropdown menu.
        </p>
        <br>
        <h2>How do I "attend" an event?</h2>
        <p>To attend an event, click on "New Attendance", and select the event you are trying to attend,
            then select your name from the dropdown menu. Then, enter the event password given to you
            by your event leader.
        </p>
        <br>
        <h2>What if I don't see my name in the dropdown menu?</h2>
        <p>If your name is not on the dropdown menu, that means you have not been added as a user.
            You will need to contact one of your organization's officers (or anyone who has access to 
            an admin account), and provide them your information, and they can create an account for you.
        </p>
        <br>
        <h2>I was at an event, but I was unable to sign in on the app. What should I do?</h2>
        <p>Anyone with an admin account is able to modify user accounts directly, and that includes
            adding points manually. Talk to one of your organization leaders and they should be able
            to credit your account with the points you should have earned.
        </p>
        <br>
        <h2>As an admin, how do I create a new event?</h2>
        <p>To create a new event, click on "New Event", and fill out all required details of the event.
            Whatever you enter for "Login code" will be the code that members will have to enter to receive
            credit for attending the event. "Eventpoints" will be the number of points members will earn
            by attending the event.
        </p>
        <br>
        <h2>As an admin, how can I modify an existing event?</h2>
        <p>Simply click on the title of the event from the main menu. From here you can click
            "edit" to modify details of the event, or "delete" to remove the event entirely.
